        title: "Salinity-Resilient Crop Health Monitoring: Automated Disease Detection in Luffa Aegyptiaca Leaves using Vision Transformer & CNN",
        abstract: "Leveraged advanced deep learning techniques to automate disease detection in Luffa Aegyptiaca leaves. Collected and categorized images of leaves infected with Cucumber Mosaic Virus, Downy Mildew, and Leaf Spot. Achieved high accuracy with both CNN and Vision Transformer models.",
        keyContributions: [
            "Developed a Vision Transformer model with a test accuracy of 99.85%.",
            "Implemented a CNN model with a test accuracy of 98.32%.",
            "Demonstrated the potential of deep learning models in automating disease detection in agricultural crops, particularly in saline-affected coastal regions."
