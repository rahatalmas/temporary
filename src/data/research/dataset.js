        description: "The 'Luffa Aegyptiaca (Sponge Gourd) Leaf Diseases' dataset is a comprehensive collection of 6,166 high-resolution JPEG images gathered from Jalkuri, Narayanganj, and Khagan, Ashulia, in the Dhaka district of Bangladesh. The dataset is divided into two subfolders: Mosaic Virus (3,661 images) and Insect Infestation (2,505 images), each resized to 854x480 pixels. Captured using iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy A52, and Samsung Galaxy A22, the images provide a detailed look at diseases affecting Luffa aegyptiaca plants. Verified by plant pathologist Abu Noman Faruq Ahmmed, this dataset is a valuable resource for developing machine learning models and computer vision algorithms in plant disease detection.",
